What is the purpose of an abstract class in OOP?

D) Interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritance of implementation.

Method overriding occurs when:
A) Two methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
B) A subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.
C) A method calls itself recursively.
D) A method is declared static.

What is a getter method primarily used for in OOP?
A) To modify the value of a private variable.

A) To refer to the superclass.
B) To refer to the current instance of the class.
C) To declare a static variable.

Which OOP relationship indicates that one object "has a" or "is part of" another object, but the child object can exist independently?
A) Composition
B) Aggregation
C) Inheritance
D) Association (general term)

What is a static member in a class?
A) A member that belongs to each object instance.
B) A member that belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object.
C) A member that cannot be modified.
D) A member that is inherited by all subclasses.

Which of the following is a drawback of using inheritance excessively?
A) Reduced code reusability.
B) Increased coupling between classes.
C) Making the code harder to extend.
